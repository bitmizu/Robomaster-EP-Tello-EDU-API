# Robomaster-EP-Tello-EDU-API
API to interface with Tello EDU and Robomaster EP, and sample codes to show how to concurrently execute and receive video stream from Tello and Robomaster EP in one code

Sample codes of how to use this API can be studied by looking at showrmstream.py. 

Samples code to control both Robomaster EP and Tello EDU concurrently, and to show video stream from one piece code can be seen in TelloRMVideoClient.py. AI code can be added into TelloRMVideoClient.py

Before using these codes, kindly download the h264 and opus libraries from https://github.com/dji-sdk/RoboMaster-SDK/tree/master/sample_code/RoboMasterEP/stream/decoder and compile h264 and opus libraries in your machine by following the instructions in the link.
